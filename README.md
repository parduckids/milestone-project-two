### 'Word Wide' is a functional and minimalist synonym website. It stands out with a unique, quirky style, featuring animated background. Breaking away from the standard format of synonym sites; it provides word definitions, example words, synonyms based on user input, and even included a fun random word generator. I've used WordsAPI and Random Words API for synonyms and random words to make it interactive and engaging.

### This website has been created as my **Milestone Project 2** submission for the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course using HTML CSS and Javascript(jQuery).
