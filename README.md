## The idea: 

* 'Word Wide' is a functional and minimalist synonym website. It stands out with a unique, quirky style, featuring animated background. Breaking away from the standard format of synonym sites; it provides word definitions, example words, synonyms based on user input, and even included a fun random word generator. I've used WordsAPI and Random Words API for synonyms and random words to make it interactive and engaging.

* This website has been created as my **Milestone Project 2** submission for the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course using HTML CSS and Javascript(jQuery).

# Design:

## Typography
* I use '[Roboto Mono]' throughout the website , which carries the same contemporary and unassuming design as the rest of the "Roboto" family. Its clean lines and minimalistic letterforms create a modern and professional appearance.
* The font is importad from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Imagery
**Typing Monster Gif:**

* Source: [Gifer](https://gifer.com)
* I used an animated gif of a playful and unique typing monster hand to encourage users to engage with the quirky design of the project.

**Background with Abstract Shapes:**

* I created the background image on [Canva](https://canva.com), a graphic design platform.
* The background features a dynamic composition of abstract shapes, providing a visually stimulating backdrop that complements the engaging design of the project with added css scrolling animation.

**Word Wide Logo:**

* Created with [Canva](https://canva.com)
* The logo features a globe, a star, and the text "Word Wide." This design plays on the word "worldwide," emphasizing the global reach of the synonym web application and adding a unique visual element to the project's branding.

## Color scheme

<!-- write about these colors and the choice  -->

## Animations and preloaders:

**Preloader with animated star gif:**

* To ensure that the loading time is less noticable and maintain the project's cohesive visual theme.

**Background animation:**
*  This animation uses keyframes to create the illusion of the background image moving down the page. By smoothly transitioning the background position, it adds a dynamic and visually appealing element to the design.
